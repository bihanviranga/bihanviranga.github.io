      <h1>Tools</h1>

      <p class="wip"><strong>This page is not complete.</strong></p>

      <p>These are the tools and technologies I use for software development.</p>


      <h2>Editors</h2>

      <h3>Neovim</h3>
      <p>
        My primary editor of choice is <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank">Neovim</a>.
        I use many customizations to fit my workflow. My dotfiles can be found <a href="https://github.com/bihanviranga/dotfiles/tree/master/vim" target="_blank">at this link</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lately, I've been trying out <a href="http://www.lazyvim.org/" target="_blank">LazyVim</a>,
        which is a Neovim <i>distribution</i>.
        I find it very easy to work with, although I don't understand half of the included plugins, or how to customize them.
      </p>

      <h3>Cursor</h3>
      <p>
        I occasionally use the <a href="https://www.cursor.com/" target="_blank">Cursor</a> editor.
        It is a VS Code fork with built in AI features to generate code. I don't like the VS Code experience in general.
        But it has its uses. I use Cursor with a Vim emulation plugin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like the code generation features. But it doesn't look like I'll move away from Neovim in the foreseeable future.
