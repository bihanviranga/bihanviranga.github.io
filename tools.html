      <h1>Tools</h1>

      <p><i>Updated: 2025-02-21</i></p>

      <p>These are the tools and technologies I use on my computers, for software development and more.</p>


      <h2>Editors</h2>

      <h3>Neovim</h3>
      <p>
        My primary editor of choice is <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank">Neovim</a>.
        I use many customizations to fit my workflow. My dotfiles can be found <a href="https://github.com/bihanviranga/dotfiles/tree/master/vim" target="_blank">at this link</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lately, I've been trying out <a href="http://www.lazyvim.org/" target="_blank">LazyVim</a>,
        which is a Neovim <i>distribution</i>.
        I find it very easy to work with, although I don't understand half of the included plugins, or how to customize them.
      </p>

      <h3>Cursor</h3>
      <p>
        I occasionally use the <a href="https://www.cursor.com/" target="_blank">Cursor</a> editor.
        It is a VS Code fork with built in AI features to generate code. I don't like the VS Code experience in general.
        But it has its uses. I use Cursor with a Vim emulation plugin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like the code generation features. But it doesn't look like I'll move permanently away from Neovim in the foreseeable future.
      </p>

      <h2>Terminal</h2>

      <p>I do most of my coding in the termial. The terminal emulator I use is <a href="https://wezterm.org" target="_blank">WezTerm</a>, on top of which I run tmux. I have <a href="https://github.com/bihanviranga/dotfiles/tree/master/tmux" target="_blank">configured my tmux</a> to help my coding and file navigation habits.</p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/bihanviranga/dotfiles/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#utilities-and-tools" target="_blank">Here is a number of command-line tools</a> that I use.</p>
