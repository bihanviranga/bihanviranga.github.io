      <h1>About This Website</h1>

      <p><i>Posted: 2025-02-13</i></p>

      <p>
        This website is created with HTML and CSS. The code is open-source and can be found at <a href="https://github.com/bihanviranga/bihanviranga.github.io/" target="_blank">this link</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Why HTML?</i>
        I have been building commercial web applications for a few years now.
        Modern web development is very complicated.
        When you use frameworks, build steps, animations, and all that fancy stuff the website becomes bloated.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is understandable for dynamic websites that require user input, need to update content dynamically, or need to connect to various servers.
        But I find it almost funny when people use React/Next.js to build static sites and blogs.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am not saying simple HTML + CSS is the only correct way to build a static website.
        But for me, it is definitely the simplest, more enjoyable way.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is no need to include 100+ <code>node_modules</code>.
        There is no need to compile anything.
        There is no fear of libraries becoming outdated.
        This website will probably look exactly the same in a browser that is 20 years old.
      </p>

      <p>
        So that is why I chose HTML + CSS to build my own website.
        This website represents everything I expect from other websites/software I use: lightweight, fast, minimalist, and zero bloat.
      </p>

      <p>
        This website was inspired by the following websites.
        This list is by no means exhaustive.
